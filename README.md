Hi, Iâ€™m Aaron @astroburke

I am a MA Physics student at Stony Brook University. I work on kinematic weak lensing with Professor von der Linden. I also work on various other astronomy projects when time permits.

Data science and visualization is also very fun! Here are our nearest neighbors, rendered on my laptop using celestial coordinates from Gaia, the datashader package, and the colorcet colormaps.
